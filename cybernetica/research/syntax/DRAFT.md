# Cybernetica - Research  on syntax constraints

## 0.0 - Abstract 
Given our recent conversation on Apple, their masterful usage of a components and architecture language, as compared to the fragmented, incoherent experience of the web, instead of wondering why this hasn't become a serious project for the web yet, I believe we should experiment with different syntax styles, researching, not only paradigms, but constraint grammars, languages that interface on top Source languages, almost like how a video game engine would provide assets instead of pure Source. 

### 0.0.1 - Baseline Abstraction 
the reason assets are required for complex projects, is because of "baseline abstraction" a theory I am researching in a separate section. essentially, the asset provides the baseline abstraction, establishing the effort at the level of composition and modularity. when we human beings have access to patterns, we have access to the foundations of language itself. whether we conceptualize these patterns as assets, templates, snippets, or blueprints, they are serving the same function of modularity, composition, (and other complex factors and properties which we are still researching)  essentially baseline abstraction.

That may be one of the fundamental things the web is missing (and similar areas of modern technology)...  at least from my personal engineering local practice. I find that I not only benefit from having a selection of block Base code, templates, snippets, and reusable patterns, but I realized that the most complex fields, and the most complex mediums, actually end up rediscovering template--driven workflows, as the primary language! it's no longer 
- "templates are just snippets you can copy and paste, or assets are just reusable things you can optionally use" ... 
- but the system itself would be entirely produced from blocks of concepts, rather than generalized the units of syntax. 

that is the main observation, which drives the hypothesis behind this project "what if code is stressful, because the language itself is fragmented? given the observations implied in the abstract study, how can we improve continuity at language source level? will this have upstream effects to the eventual output execution product of the source?" 

## 2.0 - Linguistics

### 2.0.1 - How do we human beings learn language?
this is a fascinating area of study, and essentially language is a symbiotic cybernetic interface in and of itself; 
- the language contains symbology, e.g., "git push"
- the concepts are phenomenologically human e.g., "how do I upload these files?"
- we learn when we start asking questions that thread the gaps between semiotics and phenomenology, e.g. "what is a repository?"
- we improve upon our abilities when we continuously apply these symbiotic relationships e.g., "how do I add multiple repositories?"
- we also learned when the language provides error

### 2.0.2 - How do we build languages?
This is just as fascinating than how we learn languages as human beings, because how we construct languages is essentially the reverse process of learning; 

From what we have studied, The only reason natural language works is because you cannot invent new systems at the structural level, but you can express using composition (and various other fascinating elements of linguistics). this is exactly at the level which source code is fragmenting; structure of source code, is the linguistic equivalent of operating with characters, at the lexical level. This means the developer can create their own systems and logic. this results in a discordance and fragmentation, because the level is still too granular for applied software engineering. we need to move upwards to the natural language baseline abstraction, at the level of words. a letter is too abstract, but a word is the smallest unit of meaning. from words, other words can be built and defined.

given this, the main project of this web components idea, is actually somewhat of a library for a larger interface project I'm working on, cybernetica. but that's a discussion for another day. for now, I want to experiment and research, very craft with different syntax constraints, deliberately limiting the range of what is possible with source code, essentially acting as an interface between endless source possibility, and systems-oriented fluent language design.

### 2.0 - Proposed models

### 2.0.1 - Type 1 Variants A
the first syntax variant, is essentially using pure objects and classes and nothing else. this means we remove everything else from the language. keywords, symbols, and we express everything as natural language objects in classes. everything is a chain, much like natural language sentences. 

e.g.,

```JS
new Button("Main").reuse(1).inside(Elemen("main"))
```

it's a fascinating constraint syntax, and it's already being prototyped. 

### 2.0.2 - Type 1 Variant B
there's another variant of the same type, where instead of passing in functions as references, everything is chained, even references. this requires an internal memory model for state, which could slow down the performance of programs, but as of now that is not a concern.
